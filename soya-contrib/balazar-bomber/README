Balazar Bomber Readme
---------------------

This is a small project with several aims:
	
	- write a small complete game with soya 
	- discover "best practices" for moving between game states and other such tasks
	- use as a test for a new widget set 
	- use as a test for new network code
	- blow up friends in a mad frenzy =] bomberman rocks!

Running
-------

To run the game run 
	$ python bomber.py

To test the client/server lobby run
