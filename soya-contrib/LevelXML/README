LevelXML
--------

Some python so you can store your levels as xml code. 

LevelXML.py may be used to convert your xml into a .data file. ( kind of like a xml2soya.py )

LevelReader.py actually does the work. You can import this module directly if you want to bypass the step of converting or if you wish to implement some sort of auto-conversion.
