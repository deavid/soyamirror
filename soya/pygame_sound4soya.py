If SPEED is ignored (it is present for compatibility with soya.openal4soya).
If LOOPING is true, the sound is played in loop.
If ASYNC is true, the sound is loading asynchronously (in a new thread), and
thus it does not start immediately. ASYNC has not effect if the sound is
already loaded (=cached). Usefull for OggVorbis file (take a while to
uncompress).
