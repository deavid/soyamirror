This is a snapshot of Soya 0.7.
Soya 0.7 is a full rewrite of the Soya 3D engine in Pyrex ; the
current snapshot is an alpha and unfinished version.


HOW TO INSTALL

You need :
 - Python (tested with 2.3.3)
 - OpenGL (or Mesa)
 - SDL
 - Cal3D (http://cal3d.sourceforge.net ; cal3d is sufficient, cal3d_viewer, data,... are not needed)
 - libFreeType2
 - PIL (Python Imaging Library, for loading images from image files)
 - Pyrex 0.9.2 (http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/)

Pyrex is not strictly needed to compile Soya, since the C code
generated by Pyrex is included in the source. But compiling Soya
without Pyrex would require to hack the setup.py ; if someone does
this, please mail me or commit the change in the CVS.

To compile and install Soya, do :
   python ./setup.py build --force
   su
   # Type root password
   python ./setup.py install


HOW TO HACK

If you want to modify the Pyrex sources, you'll need the latest Pyrex
0.9.2 or higher (no patch is needed now !).

Get Pyrex from http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/


WHAT (SHOULD :-) WORK

 - Math3D stuff (=Point, Vector objects)
 - Basic 3D objects (=World, Volume, Light, Camera)
 - Modeling stuff (=Material, Face, Vertex, Shape)
 - Idler (=time management stuff)
 - Text drawing stuff (including unicode support)
 - Cal3D support
 - Raypicking (except on Cal3D objects)
 - Raypicking context
 - Tree
 - Laser
 - Sprite
 - Atmosphere (=Fog, Skyplan/box)
 - File saving and opening (WARNING : the file format is not definitive !!!)
 - Particle system
 - Portal
 - Landscape
 - Blender exporter
 - TravellingCamera (still a little buggous)
 - The Soya editor


WHAT DOES NOT WORK YET

 - Animation stuff (NOT Cal3D animation)
 - WaterCube
 - Cell-shading
 - Shadow
 - Face cutter (=model beautifier)


Enjoy Soya,
