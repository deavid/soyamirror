  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES !!! ALL SDL* and SDL_* constant have been
    renamed without the SDL prefix

    below)
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES !!! materials file-format have changed !
  * Can be used along with PyGame !!!!!!
  * Animations (see tutorial lesson 11)

  * Bugfixes:
    * Memory corruption in chunk, thanks Zachary Hamm

    * Ortho Camera now works (object culling was buggy)

  * Bugfixes:
    * Bugfix in Face.get_box()

    * Particle systems unpickling was buggy
    * Raypicking was not working if the root scene was not located
      in (0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

  * Added soya.label3d.Label3D, a 2D text label at a 3D position
  * Added a module with material classes with special effects on
    textures, like gliding texture (see soya.spc_material)

  * Bugfixes:
    * Newly created materials were activated by error
    * Cal3dVolume no longer crash if it has no shape
    * changing Material.clamp didn't re-init the texture, and thus was
      having no effect
    * Camera.coord2d_to_3d now works better with ortho cameras (still
      not perfect though)
    * Bugfix on object pickling (the bug was probably introduced by a
