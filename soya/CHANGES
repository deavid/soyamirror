    extension (because of CVS). Renaming your older file is OK: the
    file format itself have not changed, (except for materials, see
    below)
  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES !!! materials file-format have changed !
  * Can be used along with PyGame !!!!!!
  * Animations (see tutorial lesson 11)

      not perfect though)
    * Bugfix on object pickling (the bug was probably introduced by a

  * Bugfixes:
    * Several bugfixes on shadows, cellshading outlines on Cal3D model
      and raypicking on Cal3D model
    * tofudemo tutorial was broken. It now works, although the
      interpolation feature add some lag. Tofu and Tofu4Soya are still
      in an unstable stage and may change radically.

* July 2006 : Soya3D 0.12
  * Massive renaming (backward compatibility is maintained through aliases):
      Idler       -> MainLoop
      Shape       -> Model
      Cal3dShape  -> AnimatedModel
      Shapifier   -> ModelBuilder
      Volume      -> Body
      Cal3dVolume -> Body (merged with Volume)
      Land        -> Terrain
  * New sound API (see soya.Sound, soya.SoundPlayer and tuto sound-1.py)
  * Static and auto_static: all Soya objects (inheriting from
    CoordSyst) have now a "static" attribute that can be use to tag
    them as static for optimizing them, and an "auto_static" attribute
    (defaulting to true) that allows Soya to automatically determine
    wether they are static or not
  * Static shadows: static object's shadows are rendered faster
  * New method MainLoop.update, for embedding Soya inside Tk (or other
    GUI or mainloop) ; MainLoop.start has been removed since it has never
    been really working
  * Font now inherits from SavedInAPath (=> you can have a data/fonts/
    directory)
  * Dynamic model deforming (see tuto deform-1.py); this feature is
    still under work and the API may change in the next release.

  * Bugfix:
    * Bugfix in 3DSmax exporter on material (thanks Snaip)

      Blender binaries.
    * Fix for 64 bits platforms.

      Backspace for erasing characters, in pudding (thanks Greg Ewing)
    * Severals memory leaks have been fixed (in particular on Terrains
      and CoordSystStates)
    * soya.widget.default_font can now be saved as any other fonts
    * Mesh deformation were buged on cellshaded models
