cdef class MainLoop:
	"""MainLoop

A main loop, with FPS regulation.

Interesting attributes:

 - fps (read only): the frame rate (number of frame per second, a usefull speed indicator).

 - running (read only): true if the MainLoop is idling (=running).

 - round_tasks: a list of callable (taking no arg) called at the very beginning of each round
                (betwenn event processing and begin_round call)

 - next_round_tasks: a list of callable (taking no arg) that will be called once, just
	 after the beginning of the next round.

 - scenes: the scenes associated to this main_loop.

 - round_duration: The duration of a round. Round is the main_loop's time unit. The main_loop calls
	 successively begin_round(), advance_time() (possibly several times) and end_round(); it
	 is granted that ALL rounds correspond to a period of duration ROUND_DURATION (though
	 the different period may not be regularly spread over time).
	 Default is 0.030.

 - min_frame_duration: minimum duration for a frame. This attribute can be used to limit
	 the maximum FPS to save CPU time; e.g. FPS higher than 30-40 is usually useless.
	 Default is 0.020, which limits FPS to 40 in theory and to about 33 in practice
	 (I don't know why there is a difference between theory and practice !).
