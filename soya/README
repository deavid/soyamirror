*********************** S O Y A   3 D ******************************
*************************** Intro **********************************

Soya 3D is a high level 3D engine for Python ; it aims at being to 3D
what Python is to programming.

It relies on OpenGL and SDL. It is designed with games in mind, and
written partly in Python and partly in Pyrex; our goal is to provide a
full architecture for making free (GPL) game of professional quality
entirely in Python. Soya can also render on PyGame surface !

Soya 3D requires:
 - Python (tested with 2.4), including Python devel
 - Pyrex 0.9.3 (http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex ;
   only for compiling Soya's CVS. If you are using Python 2.4, see also
   http://lists.copyleft.no/pipermail/pyrex/2005-February/001137.html )
 - OpenGL (or Mesa)
 - SDL (http://libsdl.org)
 - Cal3D 0.10.0 (http://cal3d.sourceforge.net ; cal3d is sufficient,
   cal3d_viewer, data,... are not needed)
 - libFreeType2 (http://www.freetype.org)
 - PIL (Python Imaging Library, for loading images from image files
   http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm)
 - GLEW (The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library http://glew.sf.net)
 - ODE
   http://www.ode.org/
For MacOSX, you also need:
 - PyObjC (pyobjc.sourceforge.net)

For sound support, you need either:
 - OpenAL (http://openal.org)


*************************** Installation ***************************

Pyrex is not strictly needed to compile Soya, since the C code
generated by Pyrex is included in the source. But compiling Soya
without Pyrex would require to hack the setup.py ; if someone does
this, please mail me or commit the change in the CVS.


Soya3D uses Python distutils for installation.
To install, type the following as root:

cd Soya3D-XXX
python ./setup.py install

You might need to edit "config.py" if some of your library are in an
exotic location (i.e. not in /usr or /usr/local).


If you get an error like :

[... lots of text here ...]
distutils.errors.DistutilsPlatformError: invalid Python installation:
unable to open /usr/lib/python2.2/config/Makefile (No such file or directory)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./setup.py", line 28, in ?
    do("cd %s; python setup.py %s -f" % (package_dir, " ".join(sys.argv[1:])))
  File "./setup.py", line 12, in do
    raise RuntimeError, command
RuntimeError: cd soya; python setup.py build -f

or something about "python2.X/config/Makefile", you NEED to install
the Python development package for your distribution
(libpython2.X-devel on Mandrake).


*************************** Running & Documentation ****************

Documentation available on Soya 3D:
 - Some modules have already doc strings !
 - Tutorials are now available in a separate package ; grab it on the
   Soya website !


*************************** Known problems *************************

 - Old NVidia proprietary drivers does not work with Soya
With these drivers, Soya compiles but initializaing Soya fails.
Drivers version 5336 is known to crash, and newer version 6106 is
known to work.


*************************** Blender exporter ***********************

The Blender exporter has been tested with Blender 2.35 ; you need a
Blender with a separate Python (i.e. Blender must be able to import
Soya).

Enjoy Soya 3D ! And stop eating meat :-) !
