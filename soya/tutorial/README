# Intro :

# You are reading the Soya tutorial. Welcome !
# Lessons basic-XXX.py explain the basic of Soya and are understood to
# be read first, and in order. Other lessons are focused on specific
# features and can be followed in (quite) any order.

# You'll find 320x240 screenshot of each tutorial lesson in ./results;
# look at them if you think you have found a bug in Soya.

# Most of the Soya's objects and functions have docstings, so you can
# get additionnal information by typing e.g. 'help(soya.Volume)' in a
# Python shell.

# Please forget about my bad English ! Enjoy Soya !
