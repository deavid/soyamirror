# Intro :

# You are reading the Soya tutorial. Welcome !
# Lessons basic-XXX.py explain the basic of Soya and are understood to
# be read first, and in order. Other lessons are focused on specific
# features and can be followed in (quite) any order.

# You'll find 320x240 screenshot of each tutorial lesson in ./results;
# look at them if you think you have found a bug in Soya.

# Most of the Soya's objects and functions have docstings, so you can
# get additionnal information by typing e.g. 'help(soya.Volume)' in a
# Python shell.

# Please forget about my bad English ! Enjoy Soya !

# Some practical advices :

# If you installed the tutorial via a binary package of a linux distribution,
# it is likely that some tutorials will require root privilege to work on 
# their data files. In that case, verify you have write access to data dir
# and data files : 
# 	[INSTALL_DIR]/tutorial/data 

# A good way to proceed anyway is to make a personal copy of the tutorial with
# your regular user, thus you will have the appropriate rights and will be safe 
# to hack tutorial code without damaging original package :
#	cp [INSTALL_DIR]/tutorial [WORK_DIR]

# Some tutorials need their level data to be created prior their execution. 
# game_skel-1.py will create the level used by other tutorials of the same 
# serie.

# To start, go in your tutorial directory and type 
#	python ./basic-1.py
# and then <Ctrl-C> from the console to terminate the soya script.

# Under linux, you can walk through all tutorials by executing.
# 	./tutorial-tour.sh

# If you are a linux distribution packager, this "tour" is a quick test to
# verify that soya and the tutorial are properly configured for your 
# distribution.
