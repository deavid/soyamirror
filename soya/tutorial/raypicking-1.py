# raypicking-1: Laser

# This lesson includes a red laser ray and 3 rotating cubes.
# Move the mouse to move the laser.
# In particular, lasers have been used while testing raypicking function.

# BTW, the laser code (in soya/laser.py) is fully in Python and uses less that 60 lines
# of code, so you might want to take a look at it.

# Main loop

soya.MainLoop(scene).main_loop()


# TODO (left as an exercice):
# Turn this tutorial lesson into a full game, where the player must shoot
# with the laser a specific target (or monsters).
# The levels includes different moving and rotating obstacles.
# A multiplayer version uses two laser, one for each player, and two targets.

# Hint :
# the laser.points list contains all the points that define the laser trajectory.
# use laser.color to change the color of the laser.

# Good luck!
