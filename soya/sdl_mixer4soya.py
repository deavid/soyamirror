If SPEED is ignored (it is present for compatibility with soya.openal4soya).
If LOOPING is true, the sound is played in loop.
If ASYNC is true, the sound is loading asynchronously (in a new thread), and

already loaded (=cached). Usefull for OggVorbis file (take a while to
uncompress).

the file is searched in {soya.path}/sounds/."""
