******************* TOFU *******************

Tofu is a practical high-level network game engine, written in Python
and based on Twisted.

Tofu is designed for games where players play one or several
characters accross several levels. This includes jump'n run games, RPG
or RTS, but not Tetris-like games or board game (chess, go,...).

It currently support client-server and single player mode;
peer-to-peer mode may be added later.

Tofu is available under the GNU GPL licence.

   - Python >= 2.3 (http://www.python.org)
   - Twisted >= 1.3 (http://twistedmatrix.com)


 * Installation:

        python ./setup.py build

and then as root:
        python ./setup.py install


 * Documentation:

A small demo is included in demo/
Dosctring are present in almost all modules; read them with pydoc.


 * TODO

Perform long task asynchronously: loading and creating levels and players.

Use UDP, at least for non-crucial states and actions.

Add peer-to-peer support.


 * HINTS

You may need to increase the maximum size of a message (Twisted limits it
by default to 99999 bytes), e.g. with:

        import tofu.client
        tofu.client.MAX_LENGTH = 2000000

and / or:

        import tofu.server
        tofu.server.MAX_LENGTH = 2000000
