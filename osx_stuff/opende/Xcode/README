If you want this to compile, you must have run the configure script.

If you want to make a universal binary, change the value of the setting 'Architectures' in Project > Edit project settings > Build and put it to "i386 ppc"
You will then have to make an hybrid config.h:
  you should get a config.h generated on a ppc architecture.
  looking at the difference of these two files (i386 and ppc config.h), surround the #define which differs like this :

ppc file:
/* #undef PENTIUM */

i386 file:
#define PENTIUM 1

hybrid file:
#if defined ppc_YES
/* #undef PENTIUM */
#elif defined i386_YES
#define PENTIUM 1
#endif


ppc file:
#define WORDS_BIGENDIAN 1

i386 file:
/* #undef WORDS_BIGENDIAN */

hybrid file:
#if defined ppc_YES
#define WORDS_BIGENDIAN 1
#elif defined i386_YES
/* #undef WORDS_BIGENDIAN */
#endif

Note: these are the two different values I found when I did this for version 0.8.0, so maybe it will work for you (if you can't have the diff).
