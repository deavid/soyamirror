If you are trying to get a framework with the new version of GLEW, follow these instructions :

â€¢ In the file glew.c, add these lines (+ added, = existing) :

+ #ifdef OSX_FRAMEWORK
+ #  include <GLEW/glew.h>
+ #else

= #include <GL/glew.h>
= #if defined(_WIN32)
= #  include <GL/wglew.h>
= #elif !defined(__APPLE__) || defined(GLEW_APPLE_GLX)
= #  include <GL/glxew.h>
= #endif

+ #endif
