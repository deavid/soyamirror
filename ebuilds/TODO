# *:
  - Fix some dependency (I think we can remove some of balazar
    and balazar-brother witch come from soya)

# Balazar:
  - Installation work, the game started, but apparently it bug,
    installation problem or balazar problem ?

# Soya:
  - Put back the tutorial
  - Check for the dependency against ode

I also have a problem with soya, I don't understand why soya doesn't use
the python bindings for cal3D or for ode, but this is another story
